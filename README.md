## My Process


## Built with

- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- ReactJS

## What I learned


1. **_Typescript Programming Language_** - The goal of TypeScript is to be a static typechecker for JavaScript programs - in other words, a tool that runs before your code runs (static) and ensures that the types of the program are correct (typechecked).
1. **_TailwindCSS Config File_** - I began by updating the style guide in the TailwindCSS file. I found that I was receiving errors - I learned that you must keep the hsl formatting and also include it in a colors section. I had to define them in the extend object.
1. **_React Recent Versions_** - I learned that you don't need to import React at the beginning of the file when the React version is more recent.


Things I needed to work on:
1. Gradient and overlay of the images
2. Adding a curve to my background colors and design
