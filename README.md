## Overview

Challenge: "Flex your layout muscles with this landing page challenge. You'll mostly be working with HTML & CSS for this project with a tiny bit of JS for the mobile menu."

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

I began my process on the Blogr Landing Page by reviewing the design materials and downloading the necessary files. From there, I was able to create a Github repo, install TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. I was able to use a template for my README that I copied over to this particular project. I added the design files style guide recommended colors and fonts in the Tailwind config file. To complete the beginning phase of setting up the project, I added the assets to the asset folder and images.

To begin my project, I started my reviewing the index html file by updating the title and icon in the website tab. From there, I worked on creating the components I would use to create the website. I structured the layout in a way that there was a Header, Body and Footer. The Header was the most complex in that I used that component to import reusable commponents and mobile vs desktop versions. After determining the structure of the website, I started by adding content into each section as a way to review the changes as I completed them. 

The navigation bar and side navigation bar was the most challenging of the project as it required more understanding of interactive pieces on the website. I was able to create a general navigation bar for the desktop version using a dropdown functionality. Additionally, I added the sign up and login buttons that have hover state functionality for the end user. I worked my way down the design file page by creating the main page content and buttons. Then I started on the body component creating three separate distinct components for the body based on section.

## What I learned

I reinforced and learned a lot of new things during this project. Some of things that were more relevant:

1. **_Typescript Programming Language_** - The goal of TypeScript is to be a static typechecker for JavaScript programs - in other words, a tool that runs before your code runs (static) and ensures that the types of the program are correct (typechecked).
2. **_TailwindCSS Config File_** - I began by updating the style guide in the TailwindCSS file. I found that I was receiving errors - I learned that you must keep the hsl formatting and also include it in a colors section. I had to define them in the extend object.
3. **_React Recent Versions_** - I learned that you don't need to import React at the beginning of the file when the React version is more recent.
4.**_Gradient Colors_** - I added a gradient to some of the backgrounds of each component and found to use the TailwindCSS gradient feature to be useful.

## Continued development

I will continue to learn more about Typescript and work on more advanced projects. Additionally, I want to continue to update this website with new features and options.
