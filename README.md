## My Process


## Built with

- Typescript

## What I learned


1. **_Typescript Programming Language_** - The goal of TypeScript is to be a static typechecker for JavaScript programs - in other words, a tool that runs before your code runs (static) and ensures that the types of the program are correct (typechecked).
